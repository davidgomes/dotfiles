These are my macOS dotfiles.

## Setting up macOS

This is a list of things I have todo when setting up a new OS X system.
I decided to write it all here because I forget about many of these things
very easily.

1. Get rid of Ctrl + -> and Ctrl + <- to change workspace and set up Command + -> instead.
2. Get rid of Ctrl + up arrow and Ctrl + down arrow, because I need those in Emacs.
3. Set up Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, etc. to change workspace.
4. Get iTerm2 and set it up with the configuration in this repository.
5. Get Alfred and set it up under Command+Space with Spotlight in Alt+Space.
6. Get Emacs and set it up with the configuration under my .emacs.d repository.
6.1. Run M-x install-missing-packages to get the packages I need.
6.2. Run M-x toggle-fullscreen to get the sweet fullscreen (just like before OS X Lion).
6.3. Run ecb-create-layout and create the directories-only layout.
7. Get Atom and set it up with the configuration in this repository.
8. Install Homebrew.
9. Install Google Chrome Beta.
10. Install Scroll Reverser and it set according to `reverser1` and `reverser2` images in this repository.
11. Install Caffeine.
12. Log In with my Apple account and install Airmail 3.
13. defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Pictures
14. Define the shortcut to move to next window inside same app according to this link

15. Set up Gestures (3 finger to drag, 4 finger to change workspace, etc.)
