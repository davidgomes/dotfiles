# OS X Dotfiles

These are my OS X dotfiles.

## Setting up OS X

This is a list of things I have todo when setting up a new OS X system.
I decided to write it all here because I forget about many of these things
very easily.

1. Get rid of Ctrl + -> and Ctrl + <- to change workspace and set up Command + -> instead.
2. Get rid of Ctrl + up arrow and Ctrl + down arrow, because I need those in Emacs.
3. Set up Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, etc. to change workspace.
4. Get iTerm2 and set it up with the configuration in this repository.
5. Get Alfred and set it up under Command+Space with Spotlight in Alt+Space.
6. Get Emacs and set it up with the configuration under my .emacs.d repository.
6.1. Run M-x install-missing-packages to get the packages I need.
7. Get Atom and set it up with the configuration in this repository.
8. Install Homebrew.
9. Install Google Chrome Beta.
10. Install Scroll Reverser and it set up like this:

11. Install Caffeine.
12. Log In with my Apple account and install Airmail 3.
